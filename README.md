Running your Cypress E2E tests on Circle CI v2.0 is very simple.
See [circle.yml](circle.yml) for the current build commands.
In general, you can either start with a base image
[cypress/base](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/base/)
or with an image that already includes Cypress tool
[cypress/internal](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/internal/).

Then check out the code and call `cypress run` command. That is it!
See test runs for this example at
[circleci.com](https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/cypress-example-docker-circle)
